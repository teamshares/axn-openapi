# Internal docs

Working documentation for **axn-openapi**: planning specs and plans (e.g. superpowers `specs/` and
`plans/`), design notes, and other agent/contributor scratch. None of it reaches consumers — the
gemspec ships only `lib/` and the root docs (allowlist), so `internal-docs/` never packages.

Reserve the top-level `docs/` directory for user-facing documentation (a hosted docs site, guides)
when the gem grows one. That's repo/site content, not gem payload — like `internal-docs/`, it isn't
in the packaged gem; the README is the doc that ships. Keep internal working docs here.
